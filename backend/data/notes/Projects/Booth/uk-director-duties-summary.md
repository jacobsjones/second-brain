# UK Company Director: What You Should Know

## Your Situation
- **Role:** Director of brother's UK Ltd company (recruitment firm)
- **Brother:** Moving to Dubai, remains shareholder
- **You:** Director with bank access, **NO equity**
- **Setup:** With barrister and business advisor

## The Bottom Line (Read This First)

**High-risk, low-reward position.** You can be held **personally liable** for company debts even without owning shares. You get all the duties and risks, none of the ownership benefits.

## Your 7 Legal Duties (Companies Act 2006)

| Duty | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Act within powers** | Follow company rules; don't overstep |
| **Promote company success** | Act for the COMPANY, not your brother |
| **Exercise independent judgment** | Think for yourself; don't just follow orders |
| **Exercise reasonable care** | Meet standards of a competent director |
| **Avoid conflicts** | Declare any interests; no secret benefits |
| **No third-party benefits** | No bribes, gifts, or side deals |
| **Declare interests** | Tell the board about any personal stakes |

**Key Point:** These duties are to the COMPANY, not to your brother as shareholder.

## Personal Liability Risks (Even Without Shares)

### 1. Wrongful Trading
If the company goes bust and you kept trading when you should have stopped → **personal contribution to debts required**

### 2. Fraudulent Trading  
If you knowingly carried on business to defraud creditors → **unlimited liability + up to 10 years prison**

### 3. HMRC Liabilities
If National Insurance or PAYE unpaid → **Personal Liability Notice** can make you personally pay

### 4. Personal Guarantees
If you personally guaranteed any company debts (common for bank loans) → **your house/assets at risk**

---

## Bank Access = Big Responsibility

As a bank signatory, you have:
- **Fiduciary duties** over company funds
- **Money laundering liability** if suspicious transactions go through
- **Personal liability** for payments made after the "insolvency point of no return"

**What this means:** If you sign a payment and the company later goes bust, you might have to repay it personally.

---

## Tax Disadvantage

| Without Shares | With Shares |
|----------------|-------------|
| Only salary income | Salary + dividends |
| Higher tax rate | Dividends taxed lower |
| Pay NICs on all income | No NICs on dividends |
| No flexibility | Can optimize tax |

**Bottom line:** You'll pay more tax than if you had equity.

## Family Business Conflicts

The director-shareholder split creates tension around:

1. **Compensation** — He wants dividends (tax efficient), you need salary (tax heavy)
2. **Information** — He owns it but you're running it; who gets what info?
3. **Control** — Who makes final decisions?
4. **Exit** — What if you want out? What if he wants you out?

---

## Dubai-UK Structure Risks

If your brother manages from Dubai:
- **Dual tax residency risk** — Company might be considered UAE-resident
- **Exit charges** — If HMRC decides company left UK
- **Documentation burden** — Must prove UK-based decision-making

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 HMRC arrears or late filings
🚩 Unexplained transactions or missing records  
🚩 Being excluded from key decisions
🚩 No Director & Officer (D&O) insurance
🚩 Brother acting as "shadow director" from Dubai
🚩 Pressure to sign documents without reading
🚩 Company taking on debt you don't understand

---

## Protective Measures

Before accepting:

1. **Shareholders' Agreement** — Defines roles, decision rights, exit terms
2. **Director's Service Contract** — Salary, duties, notice period
3. **D&O Insurance** — Covers legal costs if sued as director
4. **Regular Financial Updates** — Monthly accounts, not just annual
5. **Independent Accountant** — Someone YOU trust reviewing books
6. **No Personal Guarantees** — Don't sign them if possible

---

## Questions to Ask Your Brother

1. "Why am I becoming director instead of just an employee?"
2. "What happens if we disagree on company decisions?"
3. "What's my compensation package and how is it set?"
4. "What insurance covers me if something goes wrong?"
5. "How do I exit this role if I want to?"
6. "What decisions will you make from Dubai vs. what do I decide?"

---

## Summary

**Your position:** All the risk, none of the ownership.

**Not saying no** — just saying: Get it in writing. Know what you're signing up for. The barrister and advisor are good, but make sure YOU understand, not just them.
