# AI Voice Coach App

## The Idea
An AI-powered singing coach that transforms complete beginners into competent singers through personalized, real-time feedback.

## Why It Works
- **Massive market**: Millions want to sing but can't afford lessons (£50-100/hour)
- **AI moat**: Real-time pitch correction + personalized curriculum = hard to replicate
- **Retention**: Singing is emotional; users stick with apps that show progress

## Key Features
1. **Real-time pitch analysis** - Visual feedback while singing
2. **Structured curriculum** - 12-week roadmap from zero to competent
3. **AI vocal coach** - Text-to-speech feedback on technique
4. **Progress tracking** - Range expansion, accuracy scores, streaks
5. **Song library** - Practice with actual songs, not just scales

## Business Model
- **Freemium**: Free basic lessons, £9.99/month for full curriculum
- **B2B**: License to schools, choir groups, theater programs
- **Coaching marketplace**: Human coaches pay commission for leads

## Technical Stack
- React Native (cross-platform)
- TensorFlow.js for pitch detection
- ElevenLabs for AI coach voice
- Firebase for auth/storage

## Validation Steps
- [ ] Build MVP with 3 basic lessons
- [ ] Test with 10 non-singers for 2 weeks
- [ ] Measure: Do they improve? Do they stick?
- [ ] If retention >40% after week 1, build full app
