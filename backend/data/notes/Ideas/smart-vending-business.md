# Smart Vending Machine Business

## The Idea
High-margin vending machines in strategic locations, managed remotely with real-time inventory tracking and dynamic pricing.

## Why Now
- **Labor costs rising** → Automation more attractive
- **Cashless society** → Card/mobile payments standard
- **Data advantage** → Know exactly what sells, when, where

## Differentiation
| Traditional | Smart Vending |
|-------------|---------------|
| Stock blindly | Real-time sales data |
| Fixed pricing | Dynamic (higher at lunch rush) |
| Break & steal | CCTV + remote lock |
| Generic snacks | Local/specialty items |

## Target Locations
1. **Gyms** - Protein bars, energy drinks, headphones
2. **Offices** - Premium snacks, coffee, phone chargers
3. **Hospitals** - Healthy snacks, magazines, comfort items
4. **Universities** - Energy drinks, study snacks, basics

## Economics (Per Machine)
- **Cost**: £3,000-5,000 (used/refurbished smart machine)
- **Monthly revenue**: £800-1,500 (good location)
- **Monthly costs**: £200 (stock, rent, maintenance)
- **Payback**: 6-9 months

## First Steps
- [ ] Research 3 specific locations, get rent quotes
- [ ] Find used machine supplier (check eBay, vending auctions)
- [ ] Test 1 machine for 3 months
- [ ] If profitable, scale to 5 machines

## Risks
- **Theft/vandalism** → Insurance, CCTV, good locations
- **Stock spoilage** → Start with non-perishables
- **Location churn** → Contracts with 6-month minimums
