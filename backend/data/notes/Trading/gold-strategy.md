# Gold Trading Strategy

My approach to trading gold using YCA and Thales protocols.

## Key Principles

- Dollar cost average into [[Gold Position]] weekly
- Use Thales for binary options on gold price movements
- Monitor #macro trends for entry points

## YCA Strategy

YCA provides exposure to physical gold. Benefits:
- No custody issues
- Listed on major exchanges
- Lower fees than GLD

## Thales Integration

Thales allows speculation on gold price:
- [[Binary Options]] for short-term trades
- [[Synthetics]] for leveraged exposure
